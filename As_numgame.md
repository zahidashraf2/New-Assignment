# **Assignment Number 7 "Markdown"**

## **Step 1**

### We took the input from user to know his/her name:

```python
numbers : list = []
user_name = input("Enter your name:  ")
print()
```

## **Step 2**

### We asked the user about hsi/her three favorite numbers:

```python
for i in range(0, 3):
    num = int (input(f"Enter your {i+1} favorite number: "))
    numbers.append(num)
```

## **Step 3**

### We use the loop function to get numbers printed

1. 6
2. 8
